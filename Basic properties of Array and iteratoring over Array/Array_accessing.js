// Example: Accessing Array Elements of an Array in JavaScript are indexed from 0 so we can access array elements as follows.


var house = ["1BHK", 25000, "2BHK", 50000, "Rent", true];
alert(house[0]+" cost= "+house[1]);
var cost_1BHK = house[1];
var is_for_rent = house[5];
alert("Cost of 1BHK = "+ cost_1BHK);
